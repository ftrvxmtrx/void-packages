Subject: [PATCH 12/16] printk: remove @console_locked

The static global variable @console_locked is used to help debug VT
code to make sure that certain code paths are running with the
console_lock held. However, this information is also available with
the static global variable @consoles_paused (for locking via
console_lock()), and the static global variable @console_lock_count
(for locking via console_trylock()).

Remove @console_locked and update is_console_locked() to use the
alternative variables.
